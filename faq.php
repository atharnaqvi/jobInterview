            <h3>I submit quite many cv’s without a response, why?</h3>
            <div class="faq">
            <p>You may be over or under qualified for the job but most likely your cv is not ATS (candidate selection AI tool) compliant. <br><br>

            <h3>How do recruiters pick resume?</h3>
            <div class="faq">
            <p>Companies often receive hundreds of resumes for every job posting they put out. 
                They and their hiring managers don't have the time to go through each resume individually, 
                so they use software, often called Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), to filter through all the resumes they receive. 
            <span id=RR4></span>
            </p>
        </div>
       
            <h3>Why resume score is important?</h3> 
            <div class="faq">
            <p>You need to make sure your resume is read correctly by these ATS and resume screening software. 
                If it is not, your resume could get instantly rejected by these systems and never make its way to a recruiter or hiring manager. 
                Its why most candidates do not get a call even if they are over qualified. <br><br>
                Resume score determines whether your resume is read correctly by these ATS.

            <h3>Is one resume fit for all jobs?</h3>
            <div class="faq">
            <p>
            Simple answer is NO. ATS work around the job requirements specified in the job advert. 
            You need to alter your resume accordingly to be ATS compliant.
